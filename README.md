# INTPROG-CW2
Coursework assignement to create a pizza ordering system in Java
Towards the deadline of this coursework I decided to re-write the application.

This proved beneificial in some ways but lack luster in others.
For this reason, I submitted what I thought was an incomplete (which it was) mess of a program.
Thus, I only achieved a total mark of 66% or a 2:1.

Note: I did not attempt to implement the extended feature detailed in the coursework brief
that would of granted an extra 20% of the marks.

I lost marks due to a few JavaDoc errors and code qaulity, specifically my implementation of inheritence.
